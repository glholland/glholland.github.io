Typing garrettholland.com into your browser is so much cooler than 192.x.x.x. Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve expanded into hosting versions of this site.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve hosted 100% hand coded sites using Bootstrap and some JavaScript elements in Azure, GCP, and AWS.

I wanted to make it easier to add new content and update existing projects without having to dive deep into the codebase each time.
