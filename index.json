I also post occasional writing to avoid relearning the same things repeatedly.\nThe domain originally supported internal networking projects. Typing garrettholland.com is more memorable than an internal IP address. Since then, I have hosted several iterations here.\nI previously deployed fully hand-coded sites (Bootstrap plus light JavaScript) in Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Amazon Web Services. That exploration predated consistent use of git, so no history remains.
