I also post occasional writing to avoid relearning the same things repeatedly.\nThe domain originally supported internal networking projects. Typing garrettholland.com is more memorable than an internal IP address. Since then, I have hosted several iterations here.\nI previously deployed fully hand-coded sites (Bootstrap plus light JavaScript) in Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Amazon Web Services. That exploration predated consistent use of git, so no history remains. I also experimented with static site generators (Jekyll and Hugo) across those clouds.\nCurrent Iteration (Summer 2025) # The site is now built with Hugo and published via GitHub Pages (URL redirect). Outsourcing hosting lets me focus on content rather than infrastructure overhead.\nglholland/glholland.github.io My GitHub Pages website HTML 1 0 The most recent refresh focused on maintainability.
