Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a developer, a writer, or just someone with ideas to share, owning your own domain is a powerful statement. And the best part? It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to break the bank.\nIn fact, you can have a professional, custom-domain website for just $12 a year.\nThe Breakdown # Here is the secret recipe:\nDomain Name: ~$12/year (via Cloudflare or Google Domains) Hosting: $0 (GitHub Pages) DNS \u0026amp; SSL: $0 (Cloudflare) That\u0026rsquo;s it. No monthly hosting fees, no expensive SSL certificates, no hidden costs.\nWhy Own Your Domain? # Before we get into the \u0026ldquo;how,\u0026rdquo; let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the \u0026ldquo;why.\u0026rdquo;\nProfessionalism: yourname.com looks infinitely better than yourname.github.io or medium.com/@yourname. Portability: If you ever want to switch hosting providers (say, from GitHub Pages to Vercel or Netlify), you take your domain with you. Your audience never loses you. Control: You own the platform. You aren\u0026rsquo;t subject to the algorithm changes of social media or blogging platforms. The Setup # 1. Buy Your Domain # I recommend Cloudflare Registrar for this. They charge wholesale prices (no markup), so a .com domain is usually around $9-10/year and you\u0026rsquo;ll use the same portal for DNS changes. Google Domains is another solid option, typically around $12/year.\n2. Set Up GitHub Pages # GitHub Pages is a free hosting service that serves static files directly from a GitHub repository. It\u0026rsquo;s fast, reliable, and integrates perfectly with your development workflow.\nCreate a Repository: Go to GitHub and create a new public repository named username.github.io (replace username with your actual GitHub username). This specific naming convention tells GitHub \u0026ldquo;Hey, I want this to be my personal website.\u0026rdquo; Choose Your Tool: Simple: You can just upload an index.html file with some \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo; code. Advanced: Use a Static Site Generator (SSG) like Hugo (which this site uses), Jekyll, or Astro. These tools allow you to write content in Markdown and build a full website automatically. Push Your Code: Upload your files to the repository using Git or the GitHub web interface. Enable Pages: Go to your repository\u0026rsquo;s Settings \u0026gt; Pages. Under \u0026ldquo;Build and deployment\u0026rdquo;, ensure the source is set to \u0026ldquo;Deploy from a branch\u0026rdquo; and select your main branch (usually main or master). Tip: If you use an SSG like Hugo, you might need a GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy your site. GitHub provides pre-made templates for this!\n3. Building Your Site with Hugo # Since we mentioned Hugo, here is a quick crash course on how to get started:\nInstall Hugo: Mac: brew install hugo Windows: choco install hugo-extended Linux: sudo apt-get install hugo Create a New Site: hugo new site my-website cd my-website git init Add a Theme: Find a theme you like at themes.gohugo.io. For this example, we\u0026rsquo;ll use the popular \u0026ldquo;Ananke\u0026rdquo; theme. git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke echo \u0026#34;theme = \u0026#39;ananke\u0026#39;\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; hugo.toml Create Content: hugo new posts/my-first-post.md Run Locally: hugo server -D Navigate to http://localhost:1313 to see your site! 4. Deployment Strategy: Branch vs. Actions # When hosting on GitHub Pages, there are two main ways to publish your site. It\u0026rsquo;s helpful to understand the difference so you know what\u0026rsquo;s happening behind the scenes.\nMethod 1: Deploy from a Branch (Classic) # This is the traditional method. You tell GitHub, \u0026ldquo;Serve whatever files are in this specific branch.\u0026rdquo;\nSource Code: Lives in your main branch. Built Site: Lives in a separate branch (often called gh-pages). The Workflow: You use a tool (like a GitHub Action) to build your site and push the resulting HTML files to the gh-pages branch. GitHub then serves that branch. This is the method used in this tutorial. We use a GitHub Action to build our Hugo site and push it to a gh-pages branch, keeping our source code clean and separate from the generated output.\nMethod 2: GitHub Actions (Modern) # GitHub now supports a \u0026ldquo;pure\u0026rdquo; Actions workflow where you don\u0026rsquo;t need a separate gh-pages branch at all.\nThe Workflow: Your GitHub Action builds the site, uploads the public folder as an \u0026ldquo;artifact\u0026rdquo;, and then tells GitHub Pages to deploy that artifact directly. Pros: Cleaner repository (no extra branch). Cons: Slightly different configuration in the hugo-build.yml file. Both methods work perfectly. We stick with Method 1 in this guide because it\u0026rsquo;s robust, easy to debug (you can just look at the gh-pages branch to see exactly what is being served), and widely supported by community themes and actions.\n5. Connect Cloudflare DNS # This is where the magic happens. Cloudflare provides enterprise-grade DNS and security for free.\nSign up for a free Cloudflare account. Add your site (enter your new domain name). Cloudflare will give you two nameservers (e.g., bob.ns.cloudflare.com). Go to your domain registrar (where you bought the domain) and update the nameservers to point to these. In Cloudflare DNS settings, add CNAME records to point to your GitHub Pages URL (username.github.io). 6. Configure GitHub # Back in your GitHub repository Settings \u0026gt; Pages:\nEnter your custom domain (e.g., yourname.com) in the \u0026ldquo;Custom domain\u0026rdquo; field. Save. GitHub will automatically create a CNAME file in your repository. Check \u0026ldquo;Enforce HTTPS\u0026rdquo;. 7. Bonus: Free SSL with Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt # Security is non-negotiable today. In the past, SSL certificates cost hundreds of dollars. Now, thanks to Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt, they are free.\nOn GitHub Pages: When you check \u0026ldquo;Enforce HTTPS\u0026rdquo; in your settings, GitHub automatically requests and manages a Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt certificate for your custom domain. It handles the renewals for you, so you never have to worry about your site showing a \u0026ldquo;Not Secure\u0026rdquo; warning. Self-Hosted: If you decide to host a server yourself (e.g., on a DigitalOcean droplet or a Raspberry Pi), you can use a tool called certbot to automatically fetch and install Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt certificates for Nginx or Apache. 8. Advanced: Using Your Domain for Home Services # One of the coolest perks of owning a domain and using Cloudflare is the ability to route subdomains to internal IP addresses on your home network.\nFor example, if you have a media server or a dashboard running on your home network at 192.168.1.50, you can create a DNS record for it:\nGo to Cloudflare DNS settings. Add an A record. Name: dashboard (creates dashboard.yourname.com) Content: 192.168.1.50 (your internal IP) Now, when you are on your home Wi-Fi, you can type dashboard.yourname.com instead of remembering the IP address.\nConclusion # For the price of one fancy lunch a year, you get a professional, secure, and fast website that you fully own. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the best investments you can make for your personal brand.\nReferences \u0026amp; Documentation # Cloudflare Registrar: Official Docs GitHub Pages: Documentation GitHub Pages Deployment: Documentation Hugo: Official Documentation Cloudflare DNS: DNS Docs Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt: Getting Started Certbot: User Guide ","date":"29 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/how-to-have-a-website-for-12-a-year/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"How to Have a Website for $12 a Year","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"29 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"29 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tech/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tech","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tutorial/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tutorial","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/web-dev/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Web-Dev","type":"tags"},{"content":"Just getting set up.

I also post occasional writing to avoid relearning the same things repeatedly.\nThe domain originally supported internal networking projects. Typing garrettholland.com is more memorable than an internal IP address. Since then, I have hosted several iterations here.\nI previously deployed fully hand-coded sites (Bootstrap plus light JavaScript) in Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Amazon Web Services. That exploration predated consistent use of git, so no history remains. I also experimented with static site generators (Jekyll and Hugo) across those clouds.\nCurrent Iteration (Summer 2025) # The site is now built with Hugo and published via GitHub Pages (URL redirect).
