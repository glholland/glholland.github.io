I'm a Kubernetes Platform Engineer focused on enabling teams to deliver secure, reliable software on modern container platforms. I enjoy balancing platform reliability work (upgrades, automation, guardrails) with direct developer enablement—documentation, walkthroughs, and user group sessions.

### Objective

Apply and grow my technical depth while taking on broader platform & security challenges. Continue developing servant leadership: lifting others through automation, clarity, and collaborative incident response.

### Communication & Enablement

I facilitate the Ford Kubernetes User Group (bi‑quarterly), publish upgrade and incident advisories, coordinate vendor workshops, and translate platform constraints into actionable guidance for application teams. My goal: shorten the path from idea to production while maintaining security posture.
