I am a Kubernetes Platform and Cloud Security Engineer focused on enabling teams to deliver secure, reliable software on modern container platforms. I balance platform reliability work (upgrades, automation, guardrails) with direct developer enablement: documentation, walkthroughs, and user group sessions.

### Objective

Apply and grow my technical depth while taking on broader platform and security challenges. Continue developing servant leadership: lifting others through automation, clarity, and collaborative incident response.

### Communication and Enablement

I co-facilitate the Ford Kubernetes User Group (biâ€‘quarterly), publish upgrade and incident advisories, coordinate vendor workshops, and translate platform constraints into actionable guidance for application teams.

The goal is to shorten the path from idea to production while maintaining security posture.

### Interests (Outside Work)

In my free time, I enjoy working on my 2006 Nissan 350Z, experimenting with open source projects, building out my home lab networking, participating in endurance sports, and exploring music.

### Current Focus

Architecting scalable security frameworks that enable enterprise-wide implementation of consistent controls across diverse container deployment solutions. My focus is on creating adaptable patterns that balance robust security posture with operational flexibility, accommodating various teams' maturity levels and compliance requirements.
