I'm a Cyber Security engineer focused on enabling teams to deliver secure, reliable software on modern container platforms. I enjoy balancing platform reliability work (upgrades, automation, guardrails) with direct developer enablement—documentation, walkthroughs, and user group sessions.

I like the term Container Security Engineer because I feel it better encapsulates my focus on securing containerized applications and providing security through transparency with various Open Source tools and practices.

If you can't read the code it's a black box and I don't like!

### Objective

Apply and grow my technical depth while taking on broader platform & security challenges. Continue developing servant leadership: lifting others through automation, clarity, and collaborative incident response.

### Communication & Enablement

I facilitate the Ford Kubernetes User Group (bi‑quarterly), publish upgrade and incident advisories, coordinate vendor workshops, and translate platform constraints into actionable guidance for application teams. My goal: shorten the path from idea to production while maintaining security posture.
