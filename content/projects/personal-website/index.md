## `garrettholland.com`

Just a boy and his domain, a true love story.

### Genesis

This is my personal site, where I showcase my projects and share my resume experience, and I may end up posting a couple of blogs. (Mostly for myself because the amount of times I learn things twice is ridiculous.)

Initially I purchased this domain to utilize this for internal networking projects. Typing `garrettholland.com` into your browser is so much cooler than 192.x.x.x. Since then, I've expanded into hosting versions of this site.

I've hosted 100% hand coded sites using Bootstrap and some JavaScript elements in Azure, GCP, and AWS. That was a fun learning experience but also happened before I knew how to use `git` and GitHub so theres no history. I've deployed static sites (Jekyll/Hugo) there also.

### Current Iteration (Summer 2025)

These days, I just use GitHub pages with a URL redirect because managing cloud infrastructure is more fun on someone else's dime (thanks Ford!ðŸ˜‚)

The most recent refresh was focused on improving the usability for myself. I wanted to make it easier to add new content and update existing projects without having to dive deep into the codebase each time. I would come back to my website after six months or so and forget how everything was structured. By streamlining the process, I can spend more time creating and less time figuring out how to update things.

### Hugo Experience

I've used Hugo extensively at work and have become quite familiar with its templating system and content management features. This experience has greatly influenced the way I structure my personal site and manage content updates. Although I use the Docsy theme at work, I've opted for a more minimalistic approach on my personal site to keep things simple and focused on the content.

### Inspiration for the Masses
