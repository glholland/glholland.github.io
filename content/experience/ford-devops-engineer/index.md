**Dates:** Sep 2020 – Dec 2022

Worked across ConcourseCI (Android CI/CD) & CircleCI (iOS CI/CD) pipelines plus Spring Boot, JavaScript/Angular, and Bootstrap UI components.

### Highlights

- Led a hackathon team; resulting internal tool shipped to production and remains in active use (reduced manual review time).
- Hardened multi‑platform mobile CI/CD pipelines improving build stability and deployment consistency.
- Collaborated with app teams to streamline onboarding and reduce pipeline setup friction.
