(Mostly for myself because the amount of times I learn things twice is ridiculous.)\nInitially I purchased this domain to utilize this for internal networking projects. Typing garrettholland.com into your browser is so much cooler than 192.x.x.x. Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve expanded into hosting versions of this site.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve hosted 100% hand coded sites using Bootstrap and some JavaScript elements in Azure, GCP, and AWS. That was a fun learning experience but also happened before I knew how to use git and GitHub so theres no history. I\u0026rsquo;ve deployed static sites (Jekyll/Hugo) there also.\nCurrent Iteration (Summer 2025) # These days, I just use GitHub pages with a URL redirect because managing cloud infrastructure is more fun on someone else\u0026rsquo;s dime (thanks Ford!ðŸ˜‚)\nglholland/glholland.github.io My GitHub Pages website HTML 1 0 The most recent refresh was focused on improving the usability for myself. I wanted to make it easier to add new content and update existing projects without having to dive deep into the codebase each time. I would come back to my website after six months or so and forget how everything was structured. By streamlining the process, I can spend more time creating and less time figuring out how to update things.\nWow, this code sucks. Who wrote this?! \u0026hellip; Ah\u0026hellip; Yeah, this makes sense now. Hugo Experience # I\u0026rsquo;ve used Hugo extensively at work and have become quite familiar with its templating system and content management features.
